            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: January 11, 2024</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how we
                collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use
                our "App" (the KÃ¦ndÉªd website web app or the KÃ¦ndÉªd mobile app).
            </p>

            <h2 id="privacy-personal-data">2. Personal Data We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Account Information:</b> Email address, approximate date of birth (within the range of three
                    months), gender, profile photos, and any further information and preferences that you provide for
                    your profile.</li>
                <li><b>Location Data:</b> To help you find matches nearby.</li>
                <li><b>Communication Data:</b> Messages and interactions with other users.</li>
                <li><b>Technical Data:</b> App usage, device information, and IP address.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="privacy-processing-basis">3. Basis for Processing</h2>
            <p>We process your data based on the following legal bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Legitimate Interests:</b> To improve our services and for security purposes, we process your data
                    based on legitimate interests. This includes using the information for the operation and improvement
                    of our app, and to publicly disclose general aggregate statistics, such as the number of users and
                    their demographic distribution.</li>
                <li><b>Consent:</b> Some of your individual but completely anonymous data may be used and published for
                    research purposes, but only if you provide explicit consent in content forms presented to you within the App. Any further data use will only be implemented with your explicit consent.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2 id="privacy-data-sharing">4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We may share your data with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Other Users:</b> When your account is set to "active", all your profile information is visible to
                    other users so that they might "match" you.</li>
                <li><b>Service Providers:</b> For app functionality and analytics. This includes sharing your
                    information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API).</li>
                <li><b>Legal Obligations:</b> If required by law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="privacy-data-security">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement all reasonable measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of
                electronic transmission or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security
                against hackers or cybercriminals. The transmission of personal information to and from our services is
                at your own risk. Importantly, just like on any other dating app, all
                the information you provide on your
                profile or in your chat messages should be considered as essentially public, because other users can see
                them
                and there is no way in practice to prevent them from sharing it with anyone else. There is also no
                infallible way
                to authenticate each user's identity and profile details (such as sex, age, etc.), and therefore access
                to your profile cannot be safely restricted based on such information. We take no responsibility for
                users' actions.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-international-transfers">6. International Transfers</h2>
            <p>Some of your data may be transferred and processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA) where our
                servers or
                service
                providers are located.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-data-retention">7. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your data as long as your account is active or as needed for legal or regulatory purposes. You
                may freely request the deletion of your account at any time from within the app (under "Manage
                Account"), in which case all your
                data will be deleted
                in 30 days. The deletion request may be cancelled anytime within
                these 30 days. Immediately after a deletion request (or in case of setting the account inactive), other
                users will no longer be able to see or access your profile or any of your data. </p>

            <h2 id="privacy-your-rights">8. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Under GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, and object to processing of your
                personal
                data.
                You also have the right to data portability.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-cookies">9. Cookies</h2>
            <p>Some of our services may use cookies to enhance your experience and gather usage data.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-policy-changes">10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant
                changes.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-contact">11. Contact Us</h2>
